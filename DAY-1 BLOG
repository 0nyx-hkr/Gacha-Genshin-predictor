 searching for data in https://www.gensh.in/genshin-impact/mechanics/gacha
 Now I am using previously visited data website https://genshin-wishes.com/
   Step -1
     Learn Webscraping .............................hmm things got out of hands now okay 
     $first of all I observed data now thinking Is there need for external data$ > Lets say I have the model information and I have my pull history
                                                                                   I can use it I am guessing... So as a first step I decided to
                                                                                    make the gacha pull model 
                                                                                    
    As I startted making the model I have a doubt how does the pity rate of 5star character increases after 50,70 (hardpity,softpity)I do have a general idea 
    but now I will first apply it to the four star and observe it.
